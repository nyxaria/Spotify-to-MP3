# Spotify to MP3
A program that downloads your playlists from Spotify.

Uses `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg`, alongside the `Youtube` and `Spotify` API to get the playlist, and then for each track it finds a suitable video to download, and converts it to MP3.

It is self-contained, and should work on most OS's, excluding Linux at the moment. *note only tested on OSX*
